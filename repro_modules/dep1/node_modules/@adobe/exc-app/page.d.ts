     * Sometimes applications will need to block navigation away from the current page. The most common use case
     * for this is when a user has unsaved changes that would be lost on navigation.
     *
     * There are 3 types of navigation in unified shell that must be accounted for:
     * 1. User attempts to navigate in a way that will cause the browser to reload. This includes page refreshes, manual URL changes, and solution switcher clicks to a non-unified shell application.
     * 2. User attempts to navigate to another page hosted on unified shell via the shell. This includes workspace clicks, org changes, and solution switches to a unified shell application. Because this is only a hash history change, it does not cause a full browser reload.
     * 3. User attempts to navigate to another page in the current application via a link in the iframe.
     *
     * In order to prevent the first and second types of navigation, unified shell offers a `blockNavigation` function. To turn on navigation blocking, the application should set:
     *
     * ***Example:***
     *
     * ```typescript
     * page.blockNavigation(true);
     * ```
     * When this function is called with `true`, Unified Shell will set a `beforeUnload` handler on the page. This will block the first type of navigation. Unified Shell will also use `history.block` to block hash navigations such as org switches and workspace changes.
     * To handle the third type of navigation, applications must block the location change from within the iframe before it propogates to the shell. This is because unified shell won't know about the iframe navigation until after it happens.
     * To solve for this, solutions should `history.block` from within the iframe as well. It is important to note that only `push` location changes should be blocked. If the solution blocks all location changes, the navigation blocking prompt will be shown to the user multiple times.
     * When navigation blocking is no longer needed the application should set `runtime.blockNavigation(false)`.
     *
     * In special cases, a solution may want to allow workspace changes but block any other type of navigation. To enable this, the option `onOrgChangeOnly` should be passed in.
     *
     * ***Example:***
     *
     * ```
     * runtime.blockNavigation(true, {onOrgChangeOnly: true});
     * ```
     *
     * Please note that navigation blocking is currently only supported for tenanted solutions. If you would like to block navigation from a tenantless solution please contact a unified shell team member to discuss your use case.
